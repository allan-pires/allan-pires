Hello, I'm Allan! 

I'm a Software Developer at Traction Guest in Vancouver, Canada. Born and raised in Natal - RN (Brazil) I moved down to SÃ£o Paulo after college to work on a fintech startup called Moip, where I worked and learned how to be one with the code for three years before uprooting and moving to Canada. I also play a lot of Rocket League (yeah, the car soccer game).
