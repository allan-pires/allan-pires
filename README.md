Hello, I'm Allan! 

I'm a Software Developer at Traction Guest in Vancouver, Canada. Born and raised in Natal - RN (Brazil) I moved down to SÃ£o Paulo after college to work on a fintech startup called Moip. I worked and learned how to care about code for three years before uprooting and moving to Canada.
